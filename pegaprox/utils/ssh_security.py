"""Central SSH host-key verification for every paramiko connection PegaProx makes.

Background
----------
PegaProx connects over SSH to a fleet of hosts (PVE nodes, PBS, ESXi, XCP-ng,
storage boxes) whose host keys are not provisioned ahead of time. The historical
code used ``paramiko.AutoAddPolicy`` / ``WarningPolicy``, which accept an unknown
host key silently — flagged as a critical MitM exposure (an attacker sitting
between the hub and a node could impersonate it and capture credentials/commands).

You cannot simply switch to ``RejectPolicy``: with no pre-seeded known_hosts every
connection would fail, breaking HA fencing, V2P, storage sync, VNC tunnels, etc.

Model
-----
**Trust-on-first-use (TOFU), reject-on-change** — the standard for a fleet tool:

* paramiko itself raises ``BadHostKeyException`` when a host **already in
  known_hosts** presents a *different* key. That is the actual MitM protection,
  and it only works if known_hosts is *loaded* — which several call sites did not
  do. This module makes loading + persisting uniform, so a changed key is rejected
  everywhere on the next connection.
* The *first* time a host is seen (missing key) this policy records the key and
  continues — what a fleet tool needs. It logs every newly-recorded key for audit.
* **Strict mode** (opt-in via ``PEGAPROX_SSH_STRICT_HOST_KEYS=1``) rejects any host
  not already in known_hosts, for high-assurance deployments that seed known_hosts
  out-of-band.

This module imports nothing from ``pegaprox`` so any layer can use it without
circular-import risk. paramiko is passed in by the caller (several call sites
import it lazily).
